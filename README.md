# NodeEmberTest

Testing new concepts in web programs:
One-page gallery app run in a standard web browser, locally installed or on a web server (example: <http://mishapp.hopto.org/>)

The main project is the 'TestProject' containing the application core. It may be run primitively only with the Ember development server (useful for debugging), but is wrapped within the 'NodeEmberTest' project ('project' = an apparently 'common' way of file organization).

I have decided not to usse the Ember data model in order to try making the system better self-contained and movable. 

Please apologize the dull naming; should be, for example, MishCore and Mish in case the application will be named 'Mish' (preliminary proposal).

The TestProject README.md is auto-generated and maybe somewhat misleading(?) before qualified adjustment.

Please mail me for better information / Tore
