# NodeEmberTest

Testing new concepts in web programs:
One-page gallery app run in a standard web browser, locally installed or on a web server.

The main project is the 'TestProject' containing the application core. It may be run primitively with the Ember development server, but is wrapped within the 'NodeEmberTest' project ('project' = an apparently 'common' way of file organization).

Please apologize the dull naming; should be, for example, MishCore and Mish in case the application will be named 'Mish' (preliminary proposal).

The TestProject README.md is auto-generated and maybe somewhat misleading(?) before qualified adjustment.

Please mail me for better information / Tore
