Notable properties
==================

This system should be available for any computer with a web browser 
  locally, from a server, or a cloud

Common image formats should be acceppted, TIFF included. Also GIF images
  can be shown using fake-named 'PNG GIFs', though with limited usability

Image names (file names without extensions) must be unique within an
  album, for example, namex.png and namex.jpg may not co-exist (note:
  still not entirely automatically prohibited). File names may not 
  contain spaces (so far)
  
Images may be shown in several albums through softlinks, though not yet
  fully implemented (not easily generated etc.)

Image albums are leafs in directory trees with image files. Albums
  may be pre-populated or filled by multi-image uploads

Image descriptions are contained in the metadata of the original image
  (exception: GIFs). All texts and file names will be freely searchable
  over albums (not yet implemented)

Thumbnail images and slideshow images are automatically generated 
  when needed (example: when the original image is updated/edited)

Thumbnail images and slideshow PNG images live in the same directory 
  as the originals, prefixed with _mini_ and  _show_, respectively

Any album will contain its own auto-generated list of image names, 
  called _imdb_order.txt, with the desired image show order, and other 
  'show time properties', such as hide/show settings

The GUI is meant to be intuitive and self-explaining, with an image
  'content menu'. The user is encouraged to look att 'tool tip' texts. 
  There is an image marking tool, and the thumbnails are draggable. 
  There are '?' buttons but no manual

The ESC key has generally a 'close window/go back/leave' meaning

The 'show time design' should be ready for wall projection to any meeting.
  At show time, the slide show may be run entirely from a keyboard, 
  supplemented by mouse pointing 

The cursor appearance should be logical but also useful for pointing
